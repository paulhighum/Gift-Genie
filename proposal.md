# Project proposal
Gift Genie: saving relationships one gift recommendation at a time.

## Project Description
Gift Genie recommends gift ideas based on a series of filters the user chooses between.  

## Problem statement
Have you ever felt like your vocabulary is lacking in comparison to all of your friends? Have you ever felt insecure in a work environment with all the jargon being thrown around? Having a poor vocabulary can lead to stress, insecurity, and other negative feelings of inferiority. It can also cause stagnation in the work place and in social situation.

## How will your project solve this problem?
SIMPL solves these problems by providing an entertaining, rewarding way for users to increase their vocabulary, whether in general or for a specific field.

## Map the user experience
A user will download SIMPL on their smartphone or visit the website. They will then create an account and login. At this point the user can choose what kind of vocabulary words they would like to learn, whether a general category or an industry specific one. From there the user can select play, which will reveal unfinished words to the user related to the category they chose, along with a related hint to help solve the word. As they solve words, definitions will appear, and be saved to the user's account, so the user can go back and see the words they have learned. The user will also earn points from solving words, which they can use to customize their game in various themes and characters. As they solve words, the unfinished words will get progressively more obscure with less letters already filled in.

## What technologies do you plan to use?
This app would need Auth, Express.js, Node.js, PostgreSQL, and Knex.js to create the backend. The frontend would be written using React and React Native, along with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
