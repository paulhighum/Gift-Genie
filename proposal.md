# Project proposal
Gift Genie: saving relationships one gift recommendation at a time.

## Project Description
Gift Genie recommends gift ideas based on a series of filters the user chooses between.  

## Problem statement
Have you ever struggled to come up with a gift idea for your significant other? Has this in turn led to unnecessary stress and procrastination? Or have you ever realized you'd forgotten an event for which you'd need a gift until the last second? Pitfalls surrounding gift giving are endless.

## How will your project solve this problem?
Gift Genie solves these problems by providing gift recommendations based on factors such as length of relationship, type of relationship, preferred gender of recipient, and others.

## Map the user experience
A user will download Gift Genie on their Android smartphone. There will be a welcome screen with an enter button. The user will click enter and move to a new page displaying a series of drop-downs and radial buttons they can use to filter who the gift is for. Then the user will click the "Generate Gift Ideas" button on the bottom of the page. From there a new page will populate with gift ideas. The user can then select an idea to view more details about it, suggested purchasing locations (whether online or in person), and an approximate price range. If that gift is not to the user's liking, they can exit that view and select another gift to see its details. The user can also go back and change some of the filters if none of the ideas are to their liking.


## What technologies do you plan to use?
This app will use Kotlin, Android Studio, Node.js, Express.js, Knex.js, and PostgreSQL.
